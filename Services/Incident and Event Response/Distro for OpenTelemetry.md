- very similar to X-Ray
- provides single set of APIs, libraries, agents and collector services
- collects distributed traces and metrics from apps.
- collects metadata from resources
- Auto-instrumentation Agents to collect traces without changing code
- info can be sent to:
	- X-Ray
	- CloudWatch
	- Manage service for Prometheus
	- Partner monitoring solutions


Difference from X-Ray
- OpenTelemetry uses standardized approach with open-source APIs from Telemetry
- allows to send traces to multiple destinations simultaneously.
